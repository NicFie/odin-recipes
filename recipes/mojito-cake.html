        <li>50g light brown soft sugar</li>
        <li>Small bunch mint, leaves picked and roughly chopped</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>For the buttercream</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200g butter / dairy-free butter</li>
        <li>400g icing sugar, sieved</li>
        <li>2 limes, zested</li>
        <li></li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Butter and line two loose-bottomed 20cm round cake tins.</li>
        <li>Put the butter and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat for 5 mins with an electric whisk until pale and
            fluffy.</li>
        <li>Whisk in the eggs one at a time, then fold through the flour and grated lime zest.</li>
        <li>Divide the batter between the prepared tins and bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 mins, or until a
            skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool on wire racks.</li>
        <li>To make the syrup, put half the lime juice and all the sugar and mint leaves into a saucepan and bring to a
            simmer, adding 1 tbsp water if needed to dissolve the sugar.</li>
        <li>Gently bubble for 7-10 mins, or until syrupy.</li>
        <li>Remove from the heat and stir through the rum and remaining lime juice. Leave to infuse for 10 mins, then
            strain into a bowl. </li>
        <li>Prick the warm cakes all over with a cocktail stick and pour over the syrup. Leave to cool completely.</li>
        <li>To make the buttercream, put the butter, icing sugar and lime zest in a bowl and beat with an electric whisk
            for 5 mins until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Put one of the syrup-soaked sponges on a large serving plate and spoon over one-third of the buttercream,
            spreading it over with a palette knife. Top with the other sponge and spread the remaining icing over the
            top and sides of the cake. Decorate with the lime wedges, lime zest and mint leaves.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Will keep in the fridge for up to three days.</p>
