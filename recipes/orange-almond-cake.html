    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Cake batter</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>225g ground almonds</li>
        <li>200g caster sugar</li>
        <li>5 eggs, separated*</li>
        <li>1 1/2 oranges, chopped and pips removed (hold on to remainding half for topping)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Topping</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Good amount of icing sugar</li>
        <li>A few shots of almond-flavoured liquor/spirit (Disaranno, Soplica almond and caramel vodka etc)</li>
        <li>Flaked almonds</li>
        <li>Dairy-free dark chocolate - orange chocolate works well!</li>
        <li>Orange zest</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre heat the oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line a springform cake tin with baking paper.</li>
        <li>Place the oranges in a sauce pan with 1 tbsp of water. Bring to a simmer and continue to cook for 30
            minutes, or until the fruit is soft. Leave to cool.</li>
        <li>When the oranges are cool, use a hand blender to blitz into a thick pulp. Ensure the puree still has
            texture, it should not be smooth.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, whisk the egg whites until they form stiff peaks. Gradually whisk in half of the sugar,
            and whisk for a further minute.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the egg yolks with the rest of the sugar, until smooth. Combine with the oranges, and
            fold in the ground almonds.</li>
        <li>Stir in 3 spoonfuls of the egg whites, and when combined, fold in the rest of the egg whites.</li>
        <li>Pour the mixture into the cake tin and bake for 55 minutes, until golden and a skewer can be inserted and
            come out clean. If the cake starts to brown to quickly, cover with foil.</li>
        <li>Leave to cool</li>
        <li>Toast flaked almonds in frying pan, without any oil, until golden brown. Careful - they will be very hot!</li>
        <li>Sieve icing sugar into large bowl. Then gradually add the alcohol until desired consistency. Spread over cooled cake.</li>
        <li>Scatter over flaked almonds.</li>
        <li>Melt 2-4 squares of chocolate gradually in the microwave, then use a fork to flick over the top of the cake. Sprinkle over orange zest if desired.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Variations of this recipe could include using a mix of oranges and lemons, and limoncello in the icing. Let your imagination run wild!</p>
